**Coffee**

2D strategy game

Original idea is faster-paced, less tedious take on XCOM-type titles.  The intent is to simplify the controls and game flow, and maintain high-stakes/sense of loss.  Accomplished by 
- Limited form of permadeth
- Pausable real-time (all game-scapes)
- Smaller squads, greater variety of weapons
- Simplified tactics
- Strategy, without becoming a management sim
- Fewer fine-grained options available to the player.  Variety comes from large-scale decisions and potentially branching story tree.

Easy to pick up, over a cup of coffee.
